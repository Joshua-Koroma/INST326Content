Week 1: I did not use AI for a majority of the week, until the time came to submit the Week 1 exrcises. For this, I used ChatGPT to answer more conceptual questions when I had thoroughly stumped myself on what some of the exercises wanted. 
I do not have a link to this chat, but do have a screenshot. I also used this to try and check my answers back, if I was unsure if they were correct.


Week 2: AI usage this week was rather simple. I just used it to ask for some potential topics to be used for my team project. I didn't end up going with any of them, but I still logged the chat here: https://chatgpt.com/share/68d0b6a6-2e5c-800a-9f7a-b761b8c57d41

Week 3: I went more in depth with having chatGPT refresh me on some of the uses of for loops, since I still have some troube remembering how they work fully. I also had it review some of my answers to the exercises this week.https://chatgpt.com/share/68d9c5ba-d138-800a-91b9-de63b9c0f994)

Week 4: This week, I focused on using ChatGPT to help me understand core concepts to other classes, such as what Point estimates are for INST314(https://chatgpt.com/share/68e3223d-07a0-800a-a9ab-910fd548dab4). I also used it for the discussion for this class this week, to see ho wa sketchbook would be broken into objects and classes in Python:(https://chatgpt.com/share/68e321b8-a1f8-800a-914e-8bff78fc5f9e)

Week 5: I once again used ChatGPT for understanding the functions I needed to write for my team Functions Project. It was able to advise me on what parts of the code to keep and how to properly add them to work the way I wanted. Additionally, I got refreshers on how I could parse metadata through json as well.


Week 7: This week, my AI experience was for more focused on exam preparation. I used it to help me study for concepts that were being used in my statsitics class, such as z-scores, IQR, and critical points. (https://chatgpt.com/share/690831f8-5724-800a-8dd6-adbc1090e5c9)


Week 12: My use of ChatGPT this week gave me refreshers on using Polymorphism and Inheritance for this week's project updates, as well as learning more about ANOVA Charts in statistics(https://chatgpt.com/share/6923e4bf-bb54-800a-a385-d340f4bbc898)

Week 14: This last week, my use was mostly on regression analysis for my upcomng Stat finals(https://chatgpt.com/share/69363904-4280-800a-8f4a-c7fa59eb2358)
