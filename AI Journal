Week 1: I did not use AI for a majority of the week, until the time came to submit the Week 1 exrcises. For this, I used ChatGPT to answer more conceptual questions when I had thoroughly stumped myself on what some of the exercises wanted. 
I do not have a link to this chat, but do have a screenshot. I also used this to try and check my answers back, if I was unsure if they were correct.


Week 2: AI usage this week was rather simple. I just used it to ask for some potential topics to be used for my team project. I didn't end up going with any of them, but I still logged the chat here: https://chatgpt.com/share/68d0b6a6-2e5c-800a-9f7a-b761b8c57d41

Week 3: I went more in depth with having chatGPT refresh me on some of the uses of for loops, since I still have some troube remembering how they work fully. I also had it review some of my answers to the exercises this week.https://chatgpt.com/share/68d9c5ba-d138-800a-91b9-de63b9c0f994)
