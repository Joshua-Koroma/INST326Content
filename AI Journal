Week 1: I did not use AI for a majority of the week, until the time came to submit the Week 1 exrcises. For this, I used ChatGPT to answer more conceptual questions when I had thoroughly stumped myself on what some of the exercises wanted. 
I do not have a link to this chat, but do have a screenshot. I also used this to try and check my answers back, if I was unsure if they were correct.
